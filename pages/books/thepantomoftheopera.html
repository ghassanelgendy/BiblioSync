        <p>Description:</p>
        <p>
          When the new managers of the Paris Opera House ignore their
          predecessors' warnings about the hideous 'Opera ghost' stalking the
          theatre, it is a fatal mistake. The Phantom haunts the imagination of
          the beautiful and talented singer Christine Daaé, appearing to her as
          the 'Angel of Music' - a disembodied voice, coaching her to sing as
          she never could before. When Christine is courted by a handsome young
          viscount, the Phantom is consumed by jealousy and seeks revenge.
