        <p>Description:</p>
        <p>
          During a business visit to Count Dracula's castle in Transylvania, a
          young English solicitor finds himself at the center of a series of
          horrifying incidents. Jonathan Harker is attacked by three phantom
          women, observes the Count's transformation from human to bat form, and
          discovers puncture wounds on his own neck that seem to have been made
          by teeth. Harker returns home upon his escape from Dracula's grim
          fortress, but a friend's strange malady — involving sleepwalking,
          inexplicable blood loss, and mysterious throat wounds — initiates a
          frantic vampire hunt.
