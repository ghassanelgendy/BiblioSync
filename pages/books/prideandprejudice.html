        <p>Description:</p>
        <p>
          Set in England in the early 19th century, Pride and Prejudice tells
          the story of Mr and Mrs Bennet's five unmarried daughters after the
          rich and eligible Mr Bingley and his status-conscious friend, Mr
          Darcy, have moved into their neighbourhood. While Bingley takes an
          immediate liking to the eldest Bennet daughter, Jane, Darcy has
          difficulty adapting to local society and repeatedly clashes with the
          second-eldest Bennet daughter, Elizabeth.
