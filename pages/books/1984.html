          Winston Smith works for the Ministry of truth in London, chief city of
          Airstrip One. Big Brother stares out from every poster, the Thought
          Police uncover every act of betrayal. When Winston finds love with
          Julia, he discovers that life does not have to be dull and deadening,
          and awakens to new possibilities. Despite the police helicopters that
          hover and circle overhead, Winston and Julia begin to question the
          Party; they are drawn towards conspiracy. Yet Big Brother will not
